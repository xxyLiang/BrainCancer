Choroid plexus papillomas appear as well-marginated round or lobulated solid masses and are isoattenuating or hyperattenuating relative to normal brain parenchyma on nonenhanced scans. In as many as 24% of patients, the tumors may contain foci of calcification, which is readily demonstrated on CT scans, compared with MRI. Choroid plexus papillomas are strongly enhancing after the intravenous administration of contrast material.In children, choroid plexus papillomas can be heterogeneous in appearance because of the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, and blood products between the fronds and papillae. A heterogeneous appearance is a possible sign of malignancy. In adults, most choroid plexus papillomas are heterogeneous secondary to cystic and/or calcific degeneration. Associated findings include hydrocephalus, which may involve the lateral, third, and fourth ventricless to varying degrees. [12, 13]The presence of irregular margins should raise concerns about malignancy. Choroid plexus papillomas may have limited parenchymal invasion, which makes the distinction of the benign tumor from its malignant counterpart difficult.Ossification in choroid plexus papillomas does not occur, although it has recently been described in one case of a papilloma within the fourth ventricles in a 21-year-old man. [14]"], "MRIImageDescription": ["MRI the test of choice for the diagNOSis of choroid plexus papilloma for several reasons.Multiplanar imaging, which is possible with MRI, can be used to precisely localize and determine the extent of the choroid plexus papilloma and thereby aid in surgical planning. MRI also has the advantage of eliminating artifacts of the posterior fossa, which can occasionally be problematic with CT scanning. In addition, MRI easily depicts local parenchymal invasion, which is occasionally present, and may be useful in distinguishing benign tumors from more aggressive or malignant choroid plexus tumors.Choroid plexus papillomas can occasionally be bilateral or multiple, and interventricular extension, an ancillary diagNOStic sign of choroid plexus papilloma, is readily identified in the coronal plane. This sign is not described with other interventricular tumors. Although uncommon, interventricular extension through the foramen of Munro, cerebral aqueduct, or foramen of Luschka or Magendie is also helpful diagNOStic sign (see the following image).
